Title :- Data Manipulation

This Python script demonstrates how to normalize each row of a 2D NumPy array using broadcasting.
Row normalization is often used in machine learning, data preprocessing, and vector scaling to ensure each row has the same magnitude (L2 norm = 1).

ðŸ”¹ Features
Uses numpy.linalg.norm() to compute the L2 norm of each row.

Leverages NumPy broadcasting for efficient row-wise division.

Produces a normalized array where each row has a length of 1.
